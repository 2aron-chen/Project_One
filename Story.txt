A group of international students, currently outside of the country, working day and night to catch up with deadlines. Suddenly, they saw the God of time and asked them what kind of favor that he can do for them.
One of the students in this group asked the God of time that "Can you erase the time of the damned professor and free us?" The God of time is at a loss.
Finally, they are sent back to their lives and keep working day and night to catch up ddls again.
